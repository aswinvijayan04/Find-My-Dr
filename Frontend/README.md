# Find_My_Dr
This is the repository for the project Find My Dr. developed by Group 8. This web application is designed to streamline healthcare services by enabling patients to book and manage their appointments while allowing doctors to monitor their schedules effortlessly. Hospital administrators have the ability to add or remove doctors as needed. The platform also features a powerful search option to find hospitals by location or specific departments. Built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—our application is both user-friendly and efficient, providing an intuitive and effective solution to modern healthcare needs.
